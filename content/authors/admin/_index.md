My name is Ahmed, and I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Computer Science</a> at UCL. I am supervised by <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Barber</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCL AI Centre</a> and <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Alexander</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing</a>. My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for the prognosis and diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Diseases from medical images and other clinical information, as part of the 
<a href="https://www.osicild.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)</a> efforts to enable rapid advances in the fight against respiratory diseases.

Prior to UCL, I worked as a senior machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.intixel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intixel</a> (Cairo-based startup for AI in radiology) and spent a six-month research internship at <a href="http://inceptioniai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inception Institute of AI</a> in Abu Dhabi. I got my BSc and MSc from Mansoura University and Nile University in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Further, I have first-author research papers published in MICCAI and ISBI conferences and served as a reviewer for the [International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11263), [IEEE Access](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/),  [FAIR MICCAI Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fair-workshop-2021/organization?authuser=0), and [NILES'19](https://www.nilesconf.org/) conference.
