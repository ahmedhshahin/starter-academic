I am Ahmed, a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Computer Science</a> at UCL. Under the joint supervision of <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Barber</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCL AI Centre</a> and <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Alexander</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)</a>, my research focuses on the development of machine learning techniques for the diagnosis and prognosis of the Interstitial Lung Diseases from medical images and clinical data. My work is part of the <a href="https://www.osicild.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)</a>, an initiative aimed at promoting swift progress in the fight against respiratory diseases.

In March 2022, I completed a research internship with the Cardiovascular Imaging team at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us) in Princeton, USA, where I designed machine learning approaches to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Prior to joining UCL, I served as a senior machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.intixel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intixel</a>, a Cairo-based start-up for AI in radiology. I also undertook a six-month research internship at <a href="http://inceptioniai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inception Institute of AI</a> in Abu Dhabi. My research contributions have been published as first-author papers in prestigious conferences such as [MICCAI](http://www.miccai.org/), [MIDL](https://2022.midl.io/), [RSNA](https://www.rsna.org/annual-meeting), and [ISBI](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2022/). In addition, I have served as a reviewer for [MICCAI](http://www.miccai.org/), the [International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11263), [IEEE Access](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/), and [NILES'19](https://www.nilesconf.org/), and am currently a program committee member for the [Medical Imaging Meets NeurIPS](https://sites.google.com/view/med-neurips-2022/organization?authuser=0) and [FAIR-MICCAI](https://sites.google.com/view/fair-workshop-2021/organization?authuser=0) workshops.
